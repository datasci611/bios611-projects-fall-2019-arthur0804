Impressions: 
Your readme includes a good description of the background on UMD for those who are new to the project, and a brief description of the datasets you are using - nice job! Be sure to fill in your research question once you have finished your rough draft, since this will be important for your final grade and for the reader. 
Your html document is clean, easy to read, and has very attractive figures - well done! You have a typo in your Section 1 header; it should read as "Demographic" instead of "Deomographic". I really like your stacked graph showing the distribution of race by gender; it effectively conveys a lot of information in a single figure. I am very excited to see the results of your Chi-squared analysis! I think this information will be very useful for UMD with some added interpretation/discussion of your results. Overall, I think your analysis is very promising and I can't wait to see your final draft!

Feedback Outline: 
1. Project is organized modularly, but does not include Make
2. Both Python and R are used 
3. Docker is not used (as far as I can tell)
4. Plots are appropriate and results are communicated clearly
5. Project may be more clearly organized with an interpretation/discussion of your statistical analyses
6. Purpose can be discerned from final html but is not stated in the readme
7. The data analysis and questions being asked in the html make sense from the client's point of view 
8. Data source is explained clearly
9. Figure interpretation and results are explained sufficiently
10. Purpose and interpretation of analysis is communicated in html document 
11. Take home message is not fully communicated but this is a rough draft
